# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-12)

**Core value:** The owner stays in control along the automation↔semi-auto spectrum — the bot can answer autonomously, or propose replies the owner picks and refines, without losing trust or the ability to take over.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 (tapi Live-Shape Capture) — executing

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 8 (n8n telegram template parity (dev))
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-12

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed (v1.0): 8
- Average duration: ~11min/plan (v1.0 phase 2 sample)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work (v1.1 design, spec §2):

- [D1]: In-screen channel switcher (TopBar CenterZone segmented pill); Telegram bottom tab + Screen_Telegram placeholder removed; per-bot channel persistence `{botId}ActiveChatChannel` → Phase 6.
- [D2]: Dashboard Telegram inclusion sequenced last (server zero changes; chips + deep-link need the channel concept) → Phase 7; explicit cut line if scope shrinks.
- [D3]: Suggestions = additive v1.1 contract (`channel` + `botTgId`, `botWaId` kept) + channel-branched RAG (single-key invariant) → Phase 7 (client) / Phase 4 (workflow branch).
- [D4]: `ChatChannel` enum + `ActiveChannel`; `WappiEndpoints.Sync(channel, path)` replaces 11 URL literals; Telegram cache under `BotCache/{botId}/telegram/` (no WA migration); `OutboxEntry` gains channel → Phase 5.
- [D5]: Confirmed tapi divergences (type:"text", numeric ids, last_time/last_timestamp swap, no isGroup, reply endpoint, reaction recipient, no chat/delete, native avatars, 2FA branch) → Phases 3 (verify) + 5 (implement).
- [D6]: Live shape capture is a USER-ASSISTED gate (`secrets.json` deny-ruled) — `Tools/tapi/capture-shapes.sh`; 13 open items in tapi-shapes.md §11 → Phase 3.
- [D7]: Telegram_Bot template fixes + RAG re-stamp in BOTH Create orchestrators; WhatsApp template untouched → Phase 4.
- Phase 3 shape-capture tooling shipped: read-only Tools/tapi/capture-shapes.sh + pre-filled 13-question SHAPES.md; Q9-Q13 verdicts DEFERRED (not observable read-only). Owner-run capture is the phase-closing human gate (03-HUMAN-UAT.md), blocking Phase 5 CHAT-03/CHAT-07 media/Normalize.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Gate/Phase 3]: tapi media message shapes (messages/get) undocumented — Normalize/media work (Phase 5 CHAT-03) blocked until the owner runs the capture script against an authorized dev Telegram profile.
- [Gate/Phase 4]: TPL-06 e2e needs dev n8n (localhost:5678) + tunnel + a real authorized Telegram profile (user-assisted).
- [Constraint]: Assume Wappi response-crossing bugs apply to tapi — keep serial media queue + `_chatFetchesInFlight` gate; reset on channel switch like bot switch.
- [Constraint]: Bot workflow clones stay INACTIVE except during active testing (real contacts!); prod bagkz stays dormant.
- [Risk]: Any existing dev Telegram workflow clones carry wrong api/sync URLs — recreate after template fix.
