"""Smoke probes for the RevenueCat Events webhook mirror (Task 7, extended in Task 8-9).

Fires realistic RevenueCat webhook envelopes at the local dev n8n instance and checks
the HTTP contract: an unauthenticated request must be rejected, and every recognized
event type must return 200 -- INCLUDING CANCELLATION, whose Map Event Code node
deliberately returns zero items for that case. RevenueCat Events acks AFTER the write,
not on receipt: Webhook uses responseMode "responseNode", Map Event has
alwaysOutputData=true (so CANCELLATION's `return []` still emits one synthetic empty
item instead of killing the run), and an `If Has Payload?` gate on `app_user_id` routes
a real item to Upsert Subscriber -> Respond 200 (Postgres has onError:
continueErrorOutput -> Respond Error 500, so a genuine write failure surfaces as a
non-2xx and RevenueCat retries) while the empty/no-op item goes straight to its own
Respond 200. This is what makes CANCELLATION 200 without ever touching Postgres, and
what makes a broken Upsert Subscriber query show up as a real failure here rather than
being silently swallowed.

This script only checks HTTP status codes. It does NOT read back the database --
Postgres lives behind n8n's own credential, unreachable from a plain script, so DB-
state verification (plan/status/topup_balance after the series) is done separately:
a throwaway Manual-Trigger-then-Postgres-SELECT workflow, built and executed by hand
through the n8n-mcp tools, read once, then archived -- there is no committed script or
README section for this today, it's a one-off procedure repeated per verification pass.
DB-state assertions become probe-native in Task 11 via /webhook/GetUsage -- once that
read endpoint exists, this script should call it instead of requiring a manual read.

Usage:
    RC_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<minted-secret> python3 Tools/n8n/probe-billing.py
    N8N_BASE_URL=... RC_WEBHOOK_SECRET=... python3 Tools/n8n/probe-billing.py

The secret is never hardcoded here -- it must come from the RC_WEBHOOK_SECRET env var
(it's the value bound into the "RevenueCat Webhook" httpHeaderAuth credential on the
Webhook node; n8n itself rejects a wrong/missing Authorization header with 401/403
before the workflow ever runs, so there is no app-level auth code to probe here).

Real RevenueCat webhook envelope shape: {"event": {...}}. The Map Event Code node reads
$json.body.event ?? $json.body, so this script always sends the wrapped form to match
what RevenueCat actually POSTs (per RevenueCat's webhook docs: event.type,
event.app_user_id, event.entitlement_ids, event.product_id, event.expiration_at_ms).
